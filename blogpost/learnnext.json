    "description":"Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by the private company Vercel providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation. React documentation mentions Next.js among Recommended Toolchains  advising it to developers when building a server-rendered website with Node.js .[6] Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side. The copyright and trademarks for Next.js are owned by Vercel,[7] which also maintains and leads its open-source development.",
